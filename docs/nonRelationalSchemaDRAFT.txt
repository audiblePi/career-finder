I think there are 3 distinct entities in the career find app it would make sense to store in separate collections in MongoDB:

careerContent(
  career cluster: object array (
    cluster name: string,
    cluster image: image,
    keywords: object array (
      keyword name: string,
      keyword type: string
    )
    careers: object array (
      career name: string,
      career description: string,
      career salary: string,
      ditl: string
      celebrity: object array (
        name: string,
        photo: image,
        article: string
      )
    )
  )
)


** NOTE: user data model may also need to store an array of visited careers.
** This would be to track progress in the system and allow points to be rewarded
** for newly visited careers.
users(
  user: object array(
    userId : unique string,
    userName: string,
    password: encrypted string,
    class: string,
    points: numeric (for student accounts only),
    keywords: string array [] (for student accounts only | chat recommendations),
    type: 'student' or 'admin'
  )
)

* NOTE: we might want logging to be optional if we implement it.
* Alternatively we might want to set limits on the number of log entries
* that are retained or how long they are retained.
